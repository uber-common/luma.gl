### 2.5.0 - Fixes to examples

- Fixes to examples
- Cleanup example code
- Program.render() now takes a map of uniforms, reducing need to "set" uniforms before render.
- Experimental `requestAnimationFrame` replacement class


### 2.4.2 - Bugfix for redraw flag management

- Fix redrawFlag names


### 2.4.1 - Bugfix for headless mode

- Add headless.js to exported files


### 2.4.0 - Improve change detection

- Redraw flag management improvements


### 2.3.0 - Decoupled headless-gl dependency

- It is now necessary to import luma.gl through `luma.gl/headless` to get
headless integration.
  When using the basic `luma.gl` import, the app no longer needs to
have `gl` as a dependency.
 This should simplify build and setup for applications that don't use
headless-gl.

### 2.1.0 - Copy of 2.0.0 release

### 2.0.0 - Major API refactoring
