# AnimationLoop

While this class is named to suggest that it is a wrapper for `requestAnimationFrame`, it provides a number of features related to initialization and animation of a `WebGLRenderingContext` or `WebGL2RenderingContext`.

* Makes it easy to wait for the HTML page to load before creating resources.
* Provides a number of commonly needed variables as part of the `context` object which is passed to `onRender` and `onFinalize` callbacks.
* Objects returned by `onInitailize` will be appended to `context` object hence available to `onRender` and `onFinalize`.
* To avoid problems with page load timing, move context creation to the `onCreateContext` method.
* By default, `onRender` method manages resizing of canvas, viewport and framebuffer.


## Usage

Short example:
```js
new AnimationLoop({
  onCreateContext() {
    return createGLContext({canvas: 'canvas-0'}))
  },
  onInitialize({gl}) {
    return {
      clipSpaceQuad: new ClipSpaceQuad({gl, fs: CONTEXT_0_FRAGMENT_SHADER})
    };
  },
  onRender(context) {
    const {tick, clipSpaceQuad} = context;
    clipSpaceQuad.render({uTime: tick * 0.01});
  }
});
```

## Callback Parameters

The callbacks that the app supplies to the `AnimationLoop` will be called with an object containing named parameters. The parameter object will contain the following values:

* `gl` - This `AnimationLoop`'s `WebGLRenderingContext`.
* `canvas` - The canvas associated with the rendering context.
* `width`: The canvas width, in device pixels.
* `height`: The canvas height, in device pixels.
* `aspect`: The canvas aspect ratio (width/height) to update projection matrices
* `pixelRatio`: Pixel ratio of the canvas drawingBuffer.
* `time`: A monotonic value in milliseconds since `AnimationLoop` was created.
* `tick`: A monotonic counter that updates for every frame rendered.
* And objects that are returned by `onInitialize` method.


## Methods

### constructor

Parameters:
* `onInitialize` (callback) - function that will be called exactly once after `start()` has been called, after page load completes and a context has been created. The callback will be called with an initial object containing a gl context object. Can return a promise (e.g. for texture or model loads)
* `onCreateContext` (callback) - function without parameters that returns a `WebGLRenderingContext`. This callback will be called exactly once, after page load completes.
* `onRenderFrame` (callback) - Calling `frame` will automatically start the animation. If this is not desired, follow immediately with a `stop()`.
* `onFinalize` (callback) - Called once when animation is stopped. Can be used to delete objects or free any resources created during `onInitialize`.

### start

Restarts the animation


### stop

Stops the animation


## Remarks

* You can instantiate multiple `AnimationLoop` classes in parallel, rendering into the same or different `WebGLRenderingContext`s.
* Works both in browser and under Node.js.
* All `AnimationLoop` methods can be chained.
* Postpones context creation until the page (i.e. all HTML) has been loaded. At this time it is safe to specify canvas ids when calling `createGLContext`.
* The supplied callback function must return a WebGLRenderingContext or an error will be thrown.
* This callback registration function should not be called if a `WebGLRenderingContext` was supplied to the AnimationLoop constructor.
