# Model

The `Model` class holds all the data necessary to draw an object in
luma.gl: **shaders** (via a `Program` instance), **vertex attributes**
(a `Geometry` instance), **uniforms** and **textures**.

For most applications, the `Model` class is probably the most central luma.gl
class.

- `Model` is a subclass of Object3D, meaning that it can be used in scene graphs (by adding it to a [`Group`](group.html) or a [`Scene`](scene.html)), and it can be positioned, rotated and scaled.
- `Model` contains a [`Program`](program.html) (the shaders), a [`Geometry`](geometry.html) (containing the attributes for the primitive), any additional attributes for instanced rendering, and also stores textures and uniforms.
- Has simple boolean flags for selecting indexed and/or instanced rendering.
- Offers a simple render method that binds all attributes, uniforms and textures, selects (uses) the program, and calls the right gl draw call for the model.
- Setting buffers
- Setting textures and more.


## Usage

Set matrix information for the projection matrix and element matrix of the camera and world.

```js
program.setUniforms({
  'uMVMatrix': view,
  'uPMatrix': camera.projection
});
```

## Remarks
* All instance methods in `Model` are chainable
  (unless they return a documented value).

### Model constructor

2. **opts.vs** (VertexShader|*string*) - A vertex shader object, or source as a string.
3. **opts.fs** (FragmentShader|*string*) - A fragment shader object, ot source as a string.
4. **opts.shaderCache** (ShaderCache|null) - An optional `ShaderCache`, will be used to compile shader source strings.

### Model.setUniforms

For each `key, value` of the object passed in it executes `setUniform(key, value)`.

### Syntax:

	program.setUniforms(object);

### Arguments:

1. object - (*object*) An object with key value pairs matching a
                       uniform name and its value respectively.


1. key - (*string*) The name of the uniform to be set.
                    The name of the uniform will be matched with the name of
                    the uniform declared in the shader. You can set more
                    uniforms on the Model than its shaders use, the extra
                    uniforms will simply be ignored.
2. value - (*mixed*) The value to be set.
                     Can be a float, an array of floats, a boolean, etc.
                     When the shaders are run (through a draw call),
                     The must match the declaration.
                     There's no need to convert arrays into a typed array,
                     that's done automatically.


### Model.setInstanceCount

* instanceCount


### Model.getInstanceCount


### Model.setVertexCount

* vertexCount

### Model.getVertexCount


### Model.isPickable


### Model.setPickable


### Model.getProgram


### Model.getGeometry


### Model.getAttributes


### Model.setAttributes

* attributes = {}

### Model.getUniforms

Sets uniforms to be used. Note that uniforms are stored in a map so uniform
values not present in the argument map won't be overwritten.


### Model.setUniforms

Sets uniforms to be used. Note that uniforms are stored in a map so uniform
values not present in the argument map won't be overwritten.


### Model.setTextures

Sets textures to be used.


### Model.render

Draws the model (i.e. binds all the attributes textures and uniforms and runs
the shaders in attached program). Can be called directly but is usually called
during by Scene.render traversing the models in the scene.

* camera - Camera exposes uniforms that can be used directly in shaders
* viewMatrix


### Model.onBeforeRender()

Attaches attributes


### Model.onAfterRender()

Detaches attributes


### Model.setProgramState

Attaches attributes for primitive (from geometry) and instances (from model),
Sets uniforms and textures


### Model.unsetProgramState

Reverses setProgramState
