# Euler

A class to handle Euler rotation. More information on rotation using a Euler vector can be
found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_rotation_theorem). Generally speaking the three components of the Euler object represents the roll, pitch and yaw angles and the rotation is applied according to a specific rotation order.
