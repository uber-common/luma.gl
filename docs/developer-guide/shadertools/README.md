# ShaderTools

## Overview

shadertools is a GLSL shader module system built around a GLSL "assembler" that allows you build modular shaders. It addresses the lack of a module/import system in the GLSL language and allows you to import chunks of reusable shader code from modules into your shader source code, and organize your shader code in reusable modules.

* Enables you to import and "inject" prepackaged modules of shader code into your shaders.
* Allows you to package up reusable GLSL code as shader modules.
* Adds GPU detection and a measure of portability your shaders.


## Usage

To add/inject existing modules into your shaders, just add the modules parameter to your `assembleShaders` call:

```js
import {shaderModule} from 'library-of-shader-modules';
const {vs, fs, getUniforms, moduleMap} = assembleShaders(gl, {
  fs: '...',
  vs: '...',
  modules: [shaderModule],
  ...
})
```

To create a new shader module, you need to create a descriptor object.

```js
const MY_SHADER_MODULE = {
  name: 'my-shader-module',
  vs: ....
  fs: null,
  dependencies: [],
  deprecations: [],
  getUniforms
};
```

This object can be used as shader module directly:

```js
assembleShaders(gl, {..., modules: [MY_SHADER_MODULE]});
```


## Comparison with other WebGL shader module systems

The shadertools shader assembler is a GLSL source preprocessor. There are other systems available which can potentially be used in place of, or in combination with shadertools.


### [glslify](https://github.com/glslify/glslify)

* Lets shader modules be published (and consumed as) npm modules.
* Does full GLSL shader parsing and renames symbols to avoid conflicts.
* Note that glslify setups typically involve build tool plugins, which can be a complication.

Note: shadertools doesn't touch the preprocessor definitions used by glslify, so running glslify either before or after shadertools should work fine.


### [shadergraph](https://github.com/unconed/shadergraph)

* Detailed matching of varyings between vertex and fragment shaders
* Nice graph visualizer
* Written in coffee-script which is a consideration if considering to fork or extend.
*
