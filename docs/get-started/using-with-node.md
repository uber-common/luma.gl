# Using with Node.js

luma.gl is integrated with [headless-gl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gl) and dynamically attempts to load it when running under Node.js. Use `npm install gl` to install `headless-gl`. If `gl` is installed and properly configured on your system (`gl` can often autodetect your configuration), you should be able to run luma.gl in Node.js from the console, even on machines that do not have GPUs.

As of v5.2, no special imports are needed.

```js
import 'luma.gl';
import {createGLContext, Model, ...} from 'luma.gl';
const gl = createGLContext({width, height, ...});
```

The main limitation is that `headless-gl` only supports WebGL1 and almost no extensions, so you will need to carefully choose what features you use in your code.

* While you can certainly use [headless-gl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gl) directly to create a context (without passing it to `createGLContext`), the `createGLContext` method will automatically create a browser or headless context depending on the environment, enabling you to write cleaner application code that works both in both environments.
* When working with headless environments, also note that luma.gl has two separate implementations of its IO API functions, `loadImage`/`loadImages`, that work both in browser and under Node.js. (Browser apps tend to rely on the DOM `Image` class to load images, which is not available under Node.js).
