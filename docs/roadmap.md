# Roadmap

Interested in what is coming down the road? We are trying to make the luma.gl roadmap as public as possible.

We share information about the direction of luma.gl in the following ways:

* **[RFCs](https://github.com/uber/luma.gl/tree/master/dev-docs/RFCs)** - We are now publishing our RFCs for features in upcoming releases. RFCs are technical writeups that describe proposed feature.
* **Roadmap Document** - (this document) A high-level summary of our current direction for future releases.
* **Blog** - We will of course continue to use the [vis.gl](https://medium.com/@vis.gl) blog to share information about what we are doing.
* **Github Issues** -  always a great way to join the discussion.


## luma.gl v.Next

These are some of the main priorities for our next release:

* **Better GPGPU/WebGL2 Support** - Many stones are still left unturned here. Expect better performance, and new features for WebGL2 capable browsers (such as animations of entire attributes).
* **Transitions and Animations**.
* **Visual Effects** - Shadows, blur, postprocessing etc. This continues to be strong goal that we intend to make progress on.
* **Code Size** - luma.gl has gone through rapid development and we are overhauling the code and build processes to reduce the size.



# Roadmap for Shadertools
