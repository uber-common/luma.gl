# Upgrade Guide

## Upgrading from v6.x to v7.0

luma.gl v7.0 represents a major overhaul of the API and applications may require light porting:

- A number of changes have been made to support new features, unify similar functionality and improve performance.
- Modularization of luma.gl is also continuing and in some cases rarely used code has been removed to reduce library bloat.


## API Removals

## Loading Functions

Since luma.gl's new companion framework [loaders.gl]() now provides significantly richer and more powerful loading functionality, it did not make sense to keep the legacy luma.gl loading functions. They have been removed and now only minimal `loadFile` and `loadImage` utils are provided.

The following table provides guidance in case you are using one of the removed methods.

| Removed Function | Replacement  |
| ---              | ---          |
| `loadTexture(url, parameters)`  | `new Texture(gl, {data: url, parameters})` |
| `loadFiles`      | Multiple calls to `loadFile` |
| `loadImages`     | Multiple calls to `loadImage` |
| `loadTextures`   | As per `loadTexture` |
| `loadProgram`    | Manually load `fs` and `vs`, call `new Program(gl, {vs, fs})` |
| `loadModel`      | call `loadFile` and copy `parseModel` code from examples/lesson/16|
| `parseModel`     | call `loadFile` and copy `parseModel` code from examples/lesson/16 |

In case of image loading, note the new support for async textures, i.e the `Texture2D` constructor can now accept url strings and `Promise` objects directly.

### Sampler

The `Sampler` class has been removed as its utility was limited and it added complexity to the library. It may be added back in the future if a clear use case arises.

### Texture2D

The `Texture2D` class has been removed as its utility was limited and the status of support was unclear due to limited testing. It may be added back in the future if a clear use case arises.

### FenceSync

The `FenceSync` class has been removed as its utility was limited. If required, syncing can be done directly through the `WebGLFenceSync` object.

## Framebuffer and Texture: Copy and Blit methods

Following member function of `Framebuffer` and `Texture` classes are no longer supported, instead use the corresponding new global methods:

| Removed method                  | Replacement |
| ---                             | ---         |
| `Framebuffer.readPixels`        | `readPixelsToArray` |
| `Framebuffer.readPixelsToBuffer`| `readPixelsToBuffer` |
| `Frambuffer.copyToDataUrl`      | `copyToDataUrl` |
| `Frambuffer.copyToImage`        | `copyToImage` |
| `Frambuffer.copyToTexture`      | `copyToTexture` |
| `Frambuffer.blit`               | `blit` |
| `Texture.copyFramebuffer`       | `copyToTexture` |

Parameters have also changed in some cases, see separate section.


## API Changes

### Debug functionality moved to separate npm module

To reduce bundle size and increase separation of concerns, debug functionality is now more cleanly separated from the core library and needs to be imported from a separate npm module:

To upgrade, install the new module

```bash
npm install @luma.gl/debug
```

And replace

```js
import "luma.gl/debug";
````
with
```js
import "@luma.gl/debug";
```

### Model

Changes:
* `Model` no longer extends `ScenegraphNode`. This ensures that applications that do not need scenegraph support do not need to include scenegraph related code. Use the new `ModelNode` class to inject `Models` into scenegraphs.

Deletions:
* Redraw flag handling has been removed: `Model.setNeedsRedraw()` and `Model.getNeedsRedraw()`.

Additions:
* A new `Model.isAnimated()` method is provided, indicating that redraws are required every frame.


### Buffer

| Removed Method               | Replacement | Reason for Change |
| ---                          | ---         | ---               |
| `Buffer.updateAccessor(...)` | `Buffer.setAccessor(new Accessor(buffer.accessor, ...)` | Decoupling accessors from `Buffer` |


### Framebuffer

To maximize rendering performance, the default framebuffer is no longer preserved between frames.

The most common use case for preserving the draw buffer is capturing canvas contents into an image via `toDataURL`. This can now be done via `AnimationLoop.toDataURL` which returns a `Promise` that resolves to the canvas data URL:

```js
dataURL = await animationLoop.toDataURL();
snapshotImage.src = dataURL;
```

More generally, moving code that depends on canvas contents to the end of `onRender`, after all draw operations, will ensure that canvas contents are available.

Prior behaviour can re-enabled using the `glOptions` argument to the `createGLContext` or `AnimationLoop` constructors:

```js
new AnimationLoop({
  glOptions: {
    preserveDrawingBuffer: true
  }
});
```

Note that setting `preserveDrawingBuffers` may result in a performance drop on some platforms.


### Query

Use `Query.getTimerMilliseconds` to retrieve timer results in milliseconds. `Query.getResult` now returns raw query results.

To improve performance and simplify the library, support for tracking `Query` instances with promises has changed: The `Query` constructor no longer takes `onComplete` and `onError` callbacks, and `pollGLContext` has been removed. Instead `Query.createPoll` now provides a simple, optional promise-based API.


### Copy And Blit Parameter Unification

Names of certain parameters to these methods have been unified in an effort to reduce confusion and use the same conventions across all functions implementing image read-back, copy or blit.

This table lists parameter mapping between old and new function.

## Upgrading from v5.3 to v6.0

luma.gl v6.0 underwent a major API cleanup, resulting in a smaller, easier-to-learn API and smaller application bundles. While there are many smaller changes, the impact on most applications should be limited:

* Most removed functions were in practice rarely used by applications, and the impact on typical luma.gl applications should be limited.
* A number of API changes are related to moving attribute management from `Program` to `VertexArray`, however for higher level applications that work with the `Model` class rather than `Program` directly, there should not be much impact.


### GL Constants Import Path

The biggest change for many apps will probably be that the static `GL` symbol (that contains all WebGL2 constants) must now be separately imported GL from 'luma.gl/constants'.


### Experimental Exports: New Naming Convention

Experimental exports are now prefixed with underscore (\_). The `experimental` "name space" export has been removed.

```js
// NOW: luma.gl v6
import {_Attribute as Attribute} from 'luma.gl';

// BEFORE: luma.gl v5.x
import {experimental} from 'luma.gl';
const {Attribute} = experimental;
```

This change will enable tree-shaking bundlers to remove unused experimental exports, resulting in smaller final application bundles.


### Removed symbols

Math functions were moved from luma.gl to the separate math.gl module in v4.1. As of v6.0, they are no longer forwarded by luma.gl and now need to be imported directly from math.gl:

```js
import {radians, degrees, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix4} from 'math.gl';
```

luma.gl v6.0 removes a number of previously deprecated symbols. luma.gl will now issue an error rather than a warning if the old usage is detecated.

## Upgrading from v5.2 to v5.3

v5.3 deprecates a number of symbols. It is recommended that you replace their usage in your source code.

| Deprecated symbol                | Replacement                     | Reason     |
| ---                              | ---                             | --         |
| `GL`                             | `import GL from 'luma.gl/constants'` | Bundle size concerns |
| `deleteGLContest`                | `destroyGLContext`              | API Audit: Naming alignment |
| `pollContext`                    | `pollGLContext`                 | API Audit: Naming alignment |


## Upgrading from v5.1 to v5.2

### Running under Node.js

[Using with Node](/docs/get-started/using-with-node.md): `"import luma.gl/headless"` is no longer required for luma.gl to load headless gl and the usage has been deprecated. You can now simply remove any such import statements from your code.


### Using Debug Contexts

[Debugging](/docs/developer-guide/debugging.md): The Khronos group's `WebGLDeveloperTools` are automatically installed when luma.gl is installed, but are not actually bundled into the application unless explicitly imported. This avoids impacting the size of production bundles built on luma.gl that typically do not need debug support.

To use debug support, first import the debug tools, then call `getDebugContext` to create a debug contexts from a normal WebGL context:

```js
import "luma.gl/debug";
const gl = getDebugContext(gl);
```


## Upgrading from v4 to v5

Please read this documentation before upgrading your luma.gl dependency from v4 to v5. In v5 a number of previously deprecated features have been removed and a number of additional deprecations have been made at the same time.

Before upgrading to v5, it is highly recommended to run your application using latest v4 release, and check the console for any deprecated warnings, if there are any replace deprecated API with newer API as listed below.

### Model Class

The `Model` constructor expects a gl context as the first argument.

```js
  // v5
  Model(gl)
  Model(gl, {...opts});
  Model(gl, {program});
```

Following style construction was deprecated in v4 and is now removed in v5.

```js
  // NOT SUPPORTED
  Model({gl});
  Model({gl, ...opts});
  Model({program});
```

### useDevicePixelRatio

`useDevicePixelRatio` is used as a an argument in `AnimationLoop` class constructor and `pickModels` method. It is now deprecated in v5, but still supported with a warning message and will be removed in next major version update. It is recommended to use `useDevicePixels` instead.

### Geometry

`Geometry` class construction with inline attributes was deprecated in v4 and now removed in v5.

```js
// NOT SUPPORTED
new Geometry({
  positions: new Float32Array([ ... ]),
  colors: {
    size: 4,
    value: new Float32Array([ ... ])
  }
});
```

All attributes should be grouped inside `attribute` object.

```js
// SUPPORTED
new Geometry({
 attributes: {
   positions: new Float32Array([ ... ]),
   colors: {
     size: 4,
     value: new Float32Array([ ... ])
   }
 }
});
```

### Removed Features

Following features were deprecated in v3 and v4 are now removed in v5.

* Global symbols:

| Removed symbol / Usage | Replacement    | Comment |
| ---                  | ---              | --      |
| `withState`          | `withParameters` | State management |
| `glContextWithState` | `withParameters` | State management |
|`withParameters({frameBuffer})`| `withParameters({framebuffer})`| State management |
| `MONOLITHIC_SHADERS` | `MODULAR_SHADERS` | default shaders |
| `isWebGLContext` | `isWebGL` | WebGL context validation |
| `isWebGL2Context` | `isWebGL2` | WebGL2 context validation |
| `Camera`, `PerspectiveCamera`, `OrthoCamera` | `None` | |
| `Scene` | `None` | |

* Texture construction options:

| Removed symbol / Usage | Replacement    |
| ---                  | ---              |
| `generateMipmaps` | `mipmaps` |
| `magFilter` | `parameters[GL.TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER]` |
| `minFilter` | `parameters[GL.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER]` |
| `wrapS` | `parameters[GL.TEXTURE_WRAP_S]` |
| `wrapT` | `parameters[GL.TEXTURE_WRAP_T]` |


## Upgrading from v3 to v4

luma.gl v4 is a major release with API changes. Please read this documentation before upgrading your luma.gl's dependency from v3 to v4.
In addition, a number of previously deprecated features have been removed and a number of additional deprecations have been made at the same time in this version.


## Removed Features

Some previously deprecated classes and functions have been removed in luma.gl v4 and applications must be updated with the new classes and functions if they are still using these.

| Symbol               | Replacement      | Comment |
| ---                  | ---              | --- |

## Deprecated Features

Some classes and functions have been deprecated in luma.gl v4. They will continue to function in v4, but a warning in the console will be generated. These functions are expected to be removed in a future major versions of luma.gl.

## API Change

### Model Class

The `Model` constructor now expects a gl context as the first argument.

```js
  // v3
  Model({gl});
  Model({gl, ...opts});
  Model({program});

  // v4
  Model(gl)
  Model(gl, {...opts});
  Model(gl, {program});
```

the gl context used to be extracted from the supplied program or provided along side with other options, but in luma.gl v4, it is expected as a separate argument to the constructor. This change is because luma.gl v4 emphasizes sharing shaders rather than programs (often indirectly via shader caching / shader assembly), it is less common that a gl context is available.


## Upgrading from V2 to V3

V3 was a fairly minor release, a number of deprecations were made.
