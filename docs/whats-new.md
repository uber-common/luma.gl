# What's New

## Version 4.0

Release Date: Target early Q3 2017

A major release that brings full WebGL2 support to luma.gl, as well as support for GL state management and a shader module system.


## Major Updates

* Full WebGL2 Support
* WebGL Capability Management
* WebGL State Management
* GLSL Module System
* Debug and Profiling Support
* Documentation Refresh
* Library Size Optimizations


### WebGL2 Support

* luma.gl classes for the new WebGL2 objects (`FenceSync`, `Query`, `Sampler`, `Texture2DArray`, `Texture3D`, `TransformFeedback`).
* New `UniformBufferLayout` helper class to make uniform buffer usage easy.
* `Textures`, `Renderbuffers` and `Framebuffers` updated to handle all the new WebGL2 image formats, including floating point textures, and multiple rendertargets.
* Every existing WebGL class has been overhauled and has received additional methods that expose WebGL2 functionality whenever available.


### WebGL Capability Management

* Dramatically simplifies building apps that run on both WebGL1 and WebGL2, seamlessly leveraging extensions when available.
* Helps apps to query if a WebGL feature is available on the current platform - regardless of whether it is available through WebGL2 or through a WebGL extension.
* When a feature can be provided either through WebGL2 or through a WebGL1 extension, luma.gl provides a single API that transparently uses the available implementation.


### WebGL State Management

* Enables apps to work with WebGL context state without having to worry about global side effects, addressing one of the major weak spots of the WebGL API.
* Lets apps temporarily change global context state without having to do expensive queries to remember what values to restore it to.
* Tracks changes to the context happening outside of luma.gl to ensure that global state always remains synchronized.
* Prevents unnecessary calls to set state to current value.


### GLSL Module System

* The `ShaderAssembler` system allows shader code to be split into composable pieces.
* It is completely optional, the application can use raw shader strings, `glslify`, the `ShaderAssembler` system or any other tools in isolation or combination to generate its shaders.
* Optionally integrates with a `ShaderCache` to ensure textually equivalent shaders are only compiled once.


### Documentation Improvements

* New documentation site, aligned with deck.gl and react-vis.
* Extensive overhaul of documentation structure and contents


### Library Improvements

* Code Size - luma.gl has been fine tuned for code size (both before and after minification) and Tree Shaking (special care have been taken to avoid so called "side effects" that defeat dependency analysis during tree shaking).
* Deprecated Code Removed - "Aggressive" removal of deprecated features to help reduce library size.
* Conditional code - Removing unnecessary internal imports lets application decide what features are used. E.g. Debug code is now only imported when used (caveat: requires tree-shaking bundler).
* Separate npm packages split out (math, shader-assembler, ...)


### Internal Improvements

* Coverage Integration with Coveralls
* Many new Test Cases
* GLSL code now stored as JavaScript strings. Building luma.gl shaders no longer require transforms in your bundler (webpack/browserify).
* Now possible to directly import luma.gl ES6 code: import 'luma.gl/src'


## v3.0

Release Date: March 15, 2017

A smaller release mainly intended to align the luma.gl code base with the big deck.gl v4 release.

## Major News

### Examples
* Examples converted to ES6 to better showcase the luma.gl API.


## Debug Support
- Now uses `WEBGL_debug_shaders` extension when available to log translated shader source code.
- Performance queries, using `EXT_disjoint_timer_query` and `EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2` to provide timings.


## New `AnimationFrame` class
- Wraps requestAnimationFrame on browser and Node.js
- Supports initialization promises (wait for HTML body (canvas) to load, wait for texture images to load, etc).
- Supplies common uniforms to the frame render function: `width`, `height`, `aspect`, `tick`, `time` etc.


## Smaller changes
- Fix glTypeToArray to use `Uint8ClampedArrays` by default
- Add CORS setting to allow loading image from a different domain

## New `gl-matrix` based math library
- Optional library: All math operations directly accept JavaScript arrays
- Math classes are subclasses of JavaScript arrays (i.e. not {x,y,z} objects)
  and can thus be used interchangeably with arrays.
- Relies on `gl-matrix` for computations.
- Adds optional error checking.
- Offers more control over details like printing precision etc.

### Library Size
* Reorganized to only export a minimal surface of functions/classes.
* Tree-shaking support (package.json module keyword and dist-es6 distribution)
* Significant reduction of module dependencies.

### Experimental Additiona
- `shader-modules`, `shader-tools`, `shaders` shader module system added to `/experimental`
- `probe` moved to `/experimental`

### Deprecations/Deletions
- Old math lib deprecated.
- `FBO` class deprecated (use `Framebuffer` directly).
- `Camera` class deprecated, use math library directly.
- `Scene` class deprecated, for effects use - TBD

### Internal improvements
- Replace wildcard exports with named exports in index.js
- ES6 Conformant code base: stage-2 extensions removed
- Webpack based build
- Multiple examples now work standalone
- Experimental tree-shaking support: dist and dist-es6 directories
- Dependency removal, including removal of `autobind-decorator` dependency
- Changed precommit hook from `husky` to `pre-commit`
- `webgl` folder now contains both webgl1 and webgl2 classes

### Breaking Changes
- BREAKING CHANGE: Move node IO (loadImage etc) out of main src tree
  and into `packages`. This allows luma.gl to drop a number of big dependencies.
  The node IO code may be published as a separate module later.


## v2.0

Release Date: July 05, 2016 (evolved through a number of minor releases)

Theme: A bigger official release, a major API refactoring that introduced the WebGL classes that are now a characteristic aspect of the luma.gl API.

## Major Features

- CHANGE: Removes glslify as a dependency, apps that depend on glslify must add it to their own package.json.

### TimerQuery
  - Support EXT_disjoint_timer_query.

## Debug Support
- Built-in attribute/uniform logging
- GLSL shader compiler error handling

### Linux support
- Add missing call to getAttribLocation.

### Introduce new gl-matrix based math library.
- Move old math lib to deprecated folder.
- Move FBO to deprecated folder.
- Examples converted to ES6. AnimationFrame class updates.
- Add back persistence example
- WebGL type and constant cleanup
- Fix glTypeToArray and use clamped arrays by default

### TimerQuery, WebGL Extension doc, fix crash on Travis CI
- Support EXT_disjoint_timer_query
- Document luma.gl use of WebGL extensions.
- Fix: context creation crash when WEBGL_debug_info extension was undefined

### Debug log improvements, import fix
- Debug logs now print unused attributes more compactly, number formatting
improved.

### Add ability to import luma without io
- import "luma.gl/luma" will import luma without io functions
- import "luma.gl/io" will import luma io functions only
- omitting io functions significantly reduces dependencies
- Makes the luma object available in console for debugging.
- Some polish on luma's built-in attribute/uniform logging

### Node.js/AttributeManager/Renderer/Program.render()/Examples
- Ensure luma.gl does not fail under node until createGLContext is called.
- Program.render() now takes a map of uniforms, reducing need to "set" uniforms before render.
- New experimental Renderer class - `requestAnimationFrame` replacement.
- Improvement/fixes to examples

### Node.js support
- Ensure luma.gl does not fail under node until createGLContext is called.

### luma global initialization
- Makes the luma object available in console for debugging.
- Makes optional headless support more reliable.

### Headless support
- Removed `gl` (headless-gl) dependency, to simplify build and setup for applications that don't use headless-gl.
- `import 'luma.gl/headless'` and `npm install gl` to get headless integration.

### Improve change detection
- Redraw flag management improvements

### Decoupled headless-gl dependency
- It is now necessary to import luma.gl through `luma.gl/headless` to get
headless integration. When using the basic `luma.gl` import, the app no longer needs to
have `gl` as a dependency. This should simplify build and setup for applications that don't use headless-gl.


### Improve change detection
- Redraw flag management improvements
- New experimental Renderer class - `requestAnimationFrame` replacement.


## v1.0

Release Date: 2016

Theme: A smaller, mostly internal version that was the starting point for luma.gl development.

### Major Features
* Initial ES6 Port from PhiloGL
