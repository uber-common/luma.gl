## Transform class (New, WebGL2) (Experimental)

The new experimental [`Transform`](/#/documentation/api-reference/transform) class provides an easy-to-use interface to perform Transform Feedback operations.


## Framebuffer Class

**Pixel Readback to GPU Buffers** (WebGL2) - A new method [`Framebuffer.readPixelsToBuffer`](/#/documentation/api-reference/framebuffer) is added to asynchronously read pixel data into a `Buffer` object. This allows  applications to reduce the CPU-GPU sync time by postponing transfer of data or to completely avoid GPU-CPU sync by using the pixel data in the GPU `Buffer` object directly as data source for another GPU draw or transform feedback operation.


## Bundle Size Reduction

The impact of importing luma.gl on production application bundle sizes has been reduced, in particular when using webpack 4 with appropriate configuration. A new article about [bundling and tree shaking](/#/documentation/developer-guide/building-apps]) has been added to the Developer Guide, providing in-depth information and guidance on what numbers to expect.


## Running luma.gl in Node.js

Running of luma.gl under Node.js is now easier than ever. luma.gl v5.2 automatically loads headless-gl if installed on the system, avoiding the need for the app to import special files or add other conditional logic. See [Using with Node](/#/documentation/get-started/using-with-node) and the Upgrade Guide.


## Debug Mode Changes

To further reduce production application bundle sizes, luma.gl no longer support WebGL debug contexts by defaults, as this requires including the Khronos [WebGLDeveloperTools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGLDeveloperTools) into the bundle. WebGL debug contexts are still available, but needs to be explicitly enabled. To understand how to use WebGL debug contexts in v5.2, please refer to the article on [Debugging](/#/documentation/developer-guide/debugging) and the Upgrade Guide.


## Version 5.1

A smaller release with improvements to `TransformFeedback` support.

Date: Feb 15, 2018

## TransformFeedback Class

Two improvements Performing Transform Feedback operations has gotten easier, mainly in the following two ways:

`TransformFeedback` instances can now be supplied directly to `Model.draw` and feedback will begin and end during that draw call. Thus it is no longer necessary to work directly with the `Program` class to use transform feedback.

`Program` now build a `varyingMap` on creation depending on `varyings` array and `drawMode`. This `varyingMap` can be passed to `TransformFeedback.bindBuffers()` enabling buffers to be indexed by the name of the "varying" instead of using an index.

For more details check [`TransformFeedback`](/#/documentation/api-reference/transform-feedback) and [`Model`](/#/documentation/api-reference/model) documentation.


## Version 5.0

Date: Dec 22, 2017

A smaller release with several new examples and some under the hood changes to improve performance.


### Examples

Additional examples have been ported to the luma.gl v5 API.

* [Lesson 10](http://uber.github.io/luma.gl/#/examples/webgl-lessons/lesson-10-3d-world)
* [Lesson 11](http://uber.github.io/luma.gl/#/examples/webgl-lessons/lesson-11-sphere)
* [Lesson 12](http://uber.github.io/luma.gl/#/examples/webgl-lessons/lesson-12-point-lighting)
* [Lesson 13](http://uber.github.io/luma.gl/#/examples/webgl-lessons/lesson-13-per-fragment-lighting)


### Model Class

* `Model.draw` now supports a `moduleSettings` parameters to update shader module settings.
* `Model.render` now supports `attributes` and `samplers` arguments to be used for drawing.


### Framebuffer Binding Management

In v4 we added WebGL state management which automatically tracks all WebGL state settings. In this release we extended this feature to support framebuffer bindings. When restoring context settings, the previous framebuffer binding will also be restored.


### WebGL2 Improvements

Improvements in particular to the `Buffer`, `TransformFeedback` and `Framebuffer` classes based on use in applications.


### Shader Modules

* `fp64` - fp64 module works under more platforms/GPUs/drivers
* [`picking`](http://uber.github.io/luma.gl/#/documentation/api-reference/shader-module) shader module is moved from deck.gl to luma.gl and has been enhanced to also support object highlighting.



## Version 4.0

Release date: July 27th, 2017

<table style="border: 0;" align="center">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img height=150 src="https://raw.github.com/uber-common/deck.gl-data/master/images/whats-new/webgl2.jpg" />
        <p><i>WebGL 2</i></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

A major release that brings full WebGL2 support to luma.gl, as well as adding support for GL state management and a new shader module system.


### Full WebGL2 Support

luma.gl now exposes the complete WebGL2 APIs
* New classes expose all the new WebGL2 objects ([`Query`](/#/documentation/api-reference/query), [`Sampler`](/#/documentation/api-reference/sampler), [`Texture2DArray`](/#/documentation/api-reference/texture-2-array), [`Texture3D`](/#/documentation/api-reference/texture-3d), and [`TransformFeedback`](/#/documentation/api-reference/transform-feedback)), together with a new [`UniformBufferLayout`](/#/documentation/api-reference/uniform-buffer-layout) helper class to make uniform buffers easy to use.
* Other existing WebGL classes with new functionalites under WebGL2 have been updated.
* Add new WebGL2 texture formats and types support, including floating point textures, and multiple render targets.


### WebGL Capability Management

luma.gl provides a single unified WebGL2-style API across WebGL2, WebGL1 and WebGL extensions, and provides a simple mechanisms for querying what capabilities are available. This simplifies building apps that run on both WebGL1 and WebGL2, seamlessly allowing applications to leverage WebGL extensions when available.


### WebGL State Management

In this version, a new WebGL state management is implemented to help address one of the weak spots of the state-machine based WebGL API
* luma.gl can track certain WebGL context state changes so the app could easily set and reset WebGL states for certain operations.
* luma.gl also has a host-side WebGL state caching system that records certain WebGL states so that expansive queries into the GPU or underlying OpenGL driver won't be necessary.


### shadertools - A New Shader Module System

* The new, optional, shadertools module with the `assembleShaders` function system allows shader code to be broken into composable pieces.

* A new `ShaderCache` class is provided to ensure that identical shaders are only compiled once and no unnecessary examination and/or checks are done on already compiled WebGL shader and program objects, which significantly accelerates app start up under some occasions.


### Documentation Improvements

Complete rewrite of luma.gl's documentation. New structure and contents for every classes provided, featured on a new website with links to other frameworks in Uber's visualization framework suite, such as deck.gl and react-map-gl.


### Code Size Improvements

Significant reduction in the size of distributed luma.gl library

* Code Size - luma.gl is continuously being tuned for code size.
* Deprecated Code Removed - Removal of deprecated features to help reduce library size.
* Tree Shaking support - special care have been taken to avoid so called "side effects" that defeat dependency analysis during tree shaking).


## v3.0

Release Date: March 15, 2017

A smaller release mainly intended to align the luma.gl code base with the big deck.gl v4 release.

## Major News

### Examples
* Examples converted to ES6 to better showcase the luma.gl API.


## Debug Support
- Now uses `WEBGL_debug_shaders` extension when available to log translated shader source code.
- Performance queries, using `EXT_disjoint_timer_query` and `EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2` to provide timings.


## New `AnimationFrame` class
- Wraps requestAnimationFrame on browser and Node.js
- Supports initialization promises (wait for HTML body (canvas) to load, wait for texture images to load, etc).
- Supplies common uniforms to the frame render function: `width`, `height`, `aspect`, `tick`, `time` etc.


## Smaller changes
- Fix glTypeToArray to use `Uint8ClampedArrays` by default
- Add CORS setting to allow loading image from a different domain

## New `gl-matrix` based math library
- Optional library: All math operations directly accept JavaScript arrays
- Math classes are subclasses of JavaScript arrays (i.e. not {x,y,z} objects)
  and can thus be used interchangeably with arrays.
- Relies on `gl-matrix` for computations.
- Adds optional error checking.
- Offers more control over details like printing precision etc.

### Library Size
* Reorganized to only export a minimal surface of functions/classes.
* Tree-shaking support (package.json module keyword and dist-es6 distribution)
* Significant reduction of module dependencies.

### Experimental Additiona
- `shader-modules`, `shader-tools`, `shaders` shader module system added to `/experimental`
- `probe` moved to `/experimental`

### Deprecations/Deletions
- Old math lib deprecated.
- `FBO` class deprecated (use `Framebuffer` directly).
- `Camera` class deprecated, use math library directly.
- `Scene` class deprecated, for effects use - TBD

### Internal improvements
- Replace wildcard exports with named exports in index.js
- ES6 Conformant code base: stage-2 extensions removed
- Webpack based build
- Multiple examples now work standalone
- Experimental tree-shaking support: dist and dist-es6 directories
- Dependency removal, including removal of `autobind-decorator` dependency
- Changed precommit hook from `husky` to `pre-commit`
- `webgl` folder now contains both webgl1 and webgl2 classes

### Breaking Changes
- BREAKING CHANGE: Move node IO (loadImage etc) out of main src tree
  and into `packages`. This allows luma.gl to drop a number of big dependencies.
  The node IO code may be published as a separate module later.


## v2.0

Release Date: July 05, 2016 (evolved through a number of minor releases)

Theme: A bigger official release, a major API refactoring that introduced the WebGL classes that are now a characteristic aspect of the luma.gl API.

## Major Features

- CHANGE: Removes glslify as a dependency, apps that depend on glslify must add it to their own package.json.

### TimerQuery
  - Support EXT_disjoint_timer_query.

## Debug Support
- Built-in attribute/uniform logging
- GLSL shader compiler error handling

### Linux support
- Add missing call to getAttribLocation.

### Introduce new gl-matrix based math library.
- Move old math lib to deprecated folder.
- Move FBO to deprecated folder.
- Examples converted to ES6. AnimationFrame class updates.
- Add back persistence example
- WebGL type and constant cleanup
- Fix glTypeToArray and use clamped arrays by default

### TimerQuery, WebGL Extension doc, fix crash on Travis CI
- Support EXT_disjoint_timer_query
- Document luma.gl use of WebGL extensions.
- Fix: context creation crash when WEBGL_debug_info extension was undefined

### Debug log improvements, import fix
- Debug logs now print unused attributes more compactly, number formatting
improved.

### Add ability to import luma without io
- import "luma.gl/luma" will import luma without io functions
- import "luma.gl/io" will import luma io functions only
- omitting io functions significantly reduces dependencies
- Makes the luma object available in console for debugging.
- Some polish on luma's built-in attribute/uniform logging

### Node.js/AttributeManager/Renderer/Program.render()/Examples
- Ensure luma.gl does not fail under node until createGLContext is called.
- Program.render() now takes a map of uniforms, reducing need to "set" uniforms before render.
- New experimental Renderer class - `requestAnimationFrame` replacement.
- Improvement/fixes to examples

### Node.js support
- Ensure luma.gl does not fail under node until createGLContext is called.

### luma global initialization
- Makes the luma object available in console for debugging.
- Makes optional headless support more reliable.

### Headless support
- Removed `gl` (headless-gl) dependency, to simplify build and setup for applications that don't use headless-gl.
- `import 'luma.gl/headless'` and `npm install gl` to get headless integration.

### Improve change detection
- Redraw flag management improvements

### Decoupled headless-gl dependency
- It is now necessary to import luma.gl through `luma.gl/headless` to get
headless integration. When using the basic `luma.gl` import, the app no longer needs to
have `gl` as a dependency. This should simplify build and setup for applications that don't use headless-gl.


### Improve change detection
- Redraw flag management improvements
- New experimental Renderer class - `requestAnimationFrame` replacement.


## v1.0

Release Date: 2016

Theme: A smaller, mostly internal version that was the starting point for luma.gl development.

### Major Features
* Initial ES6 Port from PhiloGL
