# webgl-utils

This luma.gl sub-module contains a number of completely generic WebGL helper functions that luma.gl relies on. They are independent of the luma.gl API and of each other, and could possibly be of generic interest for other webgl efforts that don't want to use luma.gl itself. Since they are all MIT licensed you are welcome to copy these into your projects should you find them helpful.
